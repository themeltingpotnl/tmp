              <b>COLOR PALETTE</b>
			  <p>The color palette for The Melting Pot has a variety of colors, from cold to warm, to represent the diversity we strive for in our community. It is colorful but has a serious tone to portray the age of our target audience, which consists of young, but working expats. These colors convey the cozy feeling we want our audience to experience. </p>
              <ul class="list-unstyled">
                <li>
                  <span class="border border-secondary rounded px-2 me-1" style="background-color: #472412;"></span>
                  #472412
                  <em>- Brown is an earthy color, often seen as nurturing and comforting for reminiscing the natural world and creating a sense of warmth, safety and comfort in customers, which is essential to us. In addition, brown is a versatile color that works well with a wide range of other colors, which allows us to create different color schemes depending on the message we want to convey. This woody brown reflects the cozy and welcoming atmosphere we strive to bring to expats.</em>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <span class="border border-secondary rounded px-2 me-1" style="background-color: #F49737;"></span>
                  #F49737
                  <em>- Orange is associated with optimism and energy. It can be very valuable when conveying a message of positivity and evoke a sense of excitement about our brand. It's an attention-grabbing and warm color that really pops when combined with the teal and brown tones in our palette. Furthermore, the orange color is an icon of the Dutch culture and part of the identity of Breda, the 'Oranjestad', term often used to describe it and that can be literally translated as 'Orange City'. </em>
                </li>
				<li>
                  <span class="border border-secondary rounded px-2 me-1" style="background-color: #FBCEA4;"></span>
                  #FBCEA4
                  <em>- This is a lighter tone of the previous color, which is orange. Therefore, its meaning is exactly the same as the darker tone. We decided to include it because it would make blending and combining colors easier and our visuals more harmonic, since dark tones need to be balanced by lighter ones.</em>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <span class="border border-secondary rounded px-2 me-1" style="background-color: #C4D8D1;"></span>
                  #C4D8D1
                  <em>- This is a lighter tone of the following color, which is teal. Therefore, its meaning is exactly the same as the darker tone. But we decided to include it because it would make blending and combining colors easier and our visuals more harmonic, since dark tones need to be balanced by lighter ones. Moreover, the lighter teal evokes a deeper serenity.</em>
                </li>
				<li>
                  <span class="border border-secondary rounded px-2 me-1" style="background-color: #036460;"></span>
                  #036460
                  <em>- The color teal is a combination of the calming properties of blue and the renewal qualities of green. We want expats to feel calm in their new home and we will be a safe haven for them, during the harsh process of starting a new life abroad. Teal is a color of revitalization, which is exactly what we want to bring to our target audience. The Melting Pot is a breath of fresh air among the chaos that expats encounter in their daily lives, trying to adapt to their job and responsibilities, while often feeling lonely and homesick. </em>
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
				<b>FONT CHOICES</b>
				<p><span style="font-family: Averia Serif Libre, cursive;">Averia Serif Libre Bold</span> - we chose this font for the titles on our website because it has a vintage, rustic aspect to it, which is the feeling we want our brand to have and, therefore, we try to evoke through our visual identity. This font is also used as the main font in our logo. We want people to perceive The Melting Pot as warm and welcoming, almost reminding them of homely emotions, and believe that this font puts out these characteristics very well, while being strong and memorable.</p>
				<p><span style="font-family: Montserrat, cursive;">Montserrat Semibold</span> - this font also has a vintage aspect to it, but with a bit more of a straight and modern flare. It is easier to read, because it is less robust, and blends well with our title font. </p>
				<p><b>Open Sans</b> - this font is a recommended pairing font for the font used in our titles. It is even easier to read than Montserrat, which is ideal for a body font. We chose a simpler font for the body not only due to its readability, but also to balance out the title font, which is bold and eye-catching.</p>
			</li>
            <li>
				<b>USER INTERFACE PATTERNS</b>
					<p><b>Carousel</b> – we chose to use a carousel for three reasons:</p>
						<ul>
						  <li><b>Efficient use of space:</b> carousels allow for the display of multiple pieces of content at once, in a compact space. We believe that this is very important, because people will be able to see the most important information about our brand as soon as they visit our home page, through the visuals we will present on the carousel.</li>
               			  <li><b>Visual appeal:</b> carousels are visually interesting and can add an element of design to the website. We customized our carousel with images that represent our brand visually and emotionally and stated that the carousel made our homepage significantly more dynamic and attractive to potential consumers. </li>
               			  <li><b>Highlighting important content:</b> using a carousel allowed us to insert the most relevant information about our brand, such as what it consists of and what our next food event edition will be, right on the home page, as the first thing people see. Displaying this information with images and eye-catching visuals emphasizes the message and makes the experience with our website more interesting.</li>
            			</ul>
				<p><b>Cards</b> – we chose to use cards for the 'The Team' section, where we present the people behind our brand, for three reasons</p>
						<ul>
						  <li><b>Flexibility and variety:</b> cards are a versatile interface pattern that can be used to display a variety of content types, including text and images. They can also be used in different sizes and layouts to accommodate different devices and screen sizes. </li>
               			  <li><b>Visual appeal:</b> cards can be designed to be visually appealing and eye-catching, making it more likely that users will engage with the content.</li>
               			  <li><b>Organization:</b> cards have the ability to help make content easier to scan, by breaking it up into smaller, more digestible chunks. This can make it less tiring for users to read information and simpler to quickly find the content they are looking for.</li>
            			</ul>
				<p><b>Grids</b> – we chose to use grids in the "Values" section for the following reasons</p>
						<ul>
						  <li><b>Visual appeal:</b> the grids used display our text in a more aesthetically pleasing manner, making it nicer to read through the information. Furthermore, we used the colors of the brand to reinforce brand identity and make it consistent with the rest of the website.</li>
               			  <li><b>Organization:</b> grids allow better organization of content, since it provides a clear separation between different topics, which creates alignment and order. As a result, it is easier for users to understand the content.</li>
						</ul>
							
			 <li><strong>NAVIGATION &amp CONTENT STRUCTURE</strong> (e.g. how content units are distributed across pages)</li>
			  <p></p>
            <li>Please relate these elements to other units, for example:
              <ul>
                <li>How does website design fit the <strong>values and personality of the brand</strong>?</li>
                <li>How does website design fit the <strong>marketing and communication strategy</strong>?</li>
                <li>How does website design help showcase the <strong>unique value proposal of the product</strong>?</li>
              </ul>
